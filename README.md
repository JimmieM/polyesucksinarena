## Polye sucks in arena

Are you like me, do you suck in arena because you're getting old and there's too much going on? Are you a Priest that are getting flamed on by not min maxing your Mass dispell? Do you hate Paladin bubbles?

You've found the right addon. This addon will spam you with voice-over to "Dispell for ff". As well displaying a <span style="color:red;">BIG RED TEXT</span> on WHO to dispell, to make it EVEN easier.

### Todo

Add a list, or selectable spells to YELL AT YOU to dispell. Right now only Paladin bubble is supported. :/
